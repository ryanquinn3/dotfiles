## Be concise

In all interactions, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.


## Memory and scratch files

When developing plans or proposals, if changes are scoped to a single directory store plans in an `.ai-dev` directory in that directory.

Example: `packages/my-package/src/my-dir/.ai-dev`

For all other markdown files (plans, proposals, explorations, diagrams), use the top level `.ryanquinn3` directory.
